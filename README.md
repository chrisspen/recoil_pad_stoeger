Stoeger M3000 Recoil Pad
========================

The [Stoeger M3000](https://www.stoegerindustries.com/m3000-shotgun) is a great shotgun, but the stock recoil pad
provides practically no padding.

There are some aftermarket replacements specifically designed for this model, but they've all been discontinued.

There are some generic "one size fits all" pads, but these don't fit well and also don't provide much padding.

Since the stock recoil pad is attached via two screws and is easily removable, I designed a replacement that can be easily screwed on.

It's made of two parts:

    recoil_pad_stoeger_base.stl

        This is the part that fits into the stock and provides a foundation for attaching the flexible cushioned part.
        This can be printed in anything with a high shore hardness like PLA or ABS.

    recoil_pad_stoeger_cushion3_15.stl

        This is the "padded" cushioned part.
        Should be printed in NinjaFlex or similar rubber like material.
